# Sequence
A side-hobby programming language written in C#

Basic use is as follows:

In terminal, navigate to the bin folder of the project. Run ./Sequence /path/to/the/file.txt

Basic syntax is as follows:

print "Hello, world!"

string test = "Hi!"

print test

I recommend adding it to the PATH. See https://wpbeaches.com/how-to-add-to-the-shell-path-in-macos-using-terminal/ if you need.

There is an example program called hello_world.seq.
