# Sequence
A side-hobby programming language written in C#

Basic use is as follows:

In terminal, navigate to the bin folder of the project. Run ./Sequence /path/to/the/file.txt

Basic syntax is as follows:

print "Hello, world!"

string test = "Hi!"

print test

This is still very basic, print and string are the only working operations. More will be coming soon though.
